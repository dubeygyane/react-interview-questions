### 1. What are the key differences between class components and functional components?
- **Class Components**: Use ES6 classes, can hold state and lifecycle methods, and require `this` context binding.
- **Functional Components**: Use function syntax, are simpler, and can manage state and side effects using hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`).

### 2. What is React's Virtual DOM and how does it work?
The Virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the actual DOM. React updates the Virtual DOM first, and then efficiently reconciles it with the real DOM, minimizing direct DOM manipulations and improving performance.

### 3. Explain the concept of state and props in React.
- **State**: A local data storage that is mutable and can change over time. It is managed within the component.
- **Props**: Short for properties, props are immutable data passed from parent to child components, allowing data flow and communication between components.

### 4. What are React hooks? Name a few commonly used hooks.
Hooks are functions that allow developers to use state and lifecycle features in functional components. Commonly used hooks include:
- `useState`: For managing component state.
- `useEffect`: For side effects in components.
- `useContext`: For consuming context values.

### 5. What is the purpose of `useEffect`?
`useEffect` is a hook that manages side effects in functional components, such as data fetching, subscriptions, or manually changing the DOM. It runs after render and can clean up after itself.

### 6. How does the context API work in React?
The context API provides a way to share values across the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level. It consists of a `Provider` that provides the value and a `Consumer` that consumes the value.

### 7. What is React Router and how is it used?
React Router is a library for routing in React applications. It allows developers to create dynamic, client-side routing with components like `BrowserRouter`, `Route`, and `Link`, enabling navigation between different views without full page reloads.

### 8. What are controlled and uncontrolled components?
- **Controlled Components**: The form data is handled by the React component's state. The input value is controlled via state.
- **Uncontrolled Components**: The form data is handled by the DOM itself, and React doesn't control the input's value.

### 9. What is the significance of keys in React?
Keys help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed. They are essential for efficient updates and reconciliation when rendering lists of components.

### 10. How do you optimize performance in a React application?
- Use React's `memo` for functional components to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
- Use `PureComponent` for class components.
- Optimize state management and avoid deep nesting.
- Use `React.lazy` and `Suspense` for code splitting.

### 11. What are higher-order components (HOCs)?
HOCs are functions that take a component and return a new component. They are used for reusing component logic and can enhance a component by adding additional features or data.

### 12. What is the purpose of `React.memo`?
`React.memo` is a higher-order component that memoizes a functional component, preventing it from re-rendering unless its props change.

### 13. How do you handle forms in React?
Forms can be handled using controlled components by managing their values in the state. The input fields' values are tied to the component's state via the `value` attribute, and changes are handled using `onChange` events.

### 14. What is the difference between `useState` and `useReducer`?
- **useState**: A hook that allows managing state within a functional component, suitable for simple state management.
- **useReducer**: A hook that manages more complex state logic, ideal for state that depends on previous states or when managing multiple state values.

### 15. Explain error boundaries in React.
Error boundaries are React components that catch JavaScript errors in their child component tree. They prevent the entire application from crashing and can display a fallback UI when an error occurs.

### 16. What is the purpose of the `useRef` hook?
`useRef` is a hook that returns a mutable object whose `.current` property can hold a value or a reference to a DOM element. It is used for accessing DOM elements directly or storing a mutable value that persists across renders.

### 17. What is a fragment in React?
Fragments are a way to group multiple elements without adding extra nodes to the DOM. They can be created using `<React.Fragment>` or the shorthand `<>` syntax.

### 18. How can you achieve code splitting in a React application?
Code splitting can be achieved using dynamic imports with `React.lazy` and `Suspense`. This allows loading components only when they are needed, improving the initial load time.

### 19. What is the role of Redux in a React application?
Redux is a state management library that helps manage application state in a predictable way. It centralizes the application state and allows components to subscribe to changes, making data flow easier.

### 20. What are React lifecycle methods?
Lifecycle methods are hooks in class components that allow developers to run code at specific points in a component's lifecycle, such as `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount`.

### 21. How do you implement routing in a React application?
Routing can be implemented using React Router. Components like `BrowserRouter`, `Route`, and `Switch` are used to define routes and render specific components based on the current URL.

### 22. What is lazy loading in React?
Lazy loading is a technique to defer loading of non-essential resources until they are needed. In React, it can be achieved using `React.lazy` and `Suspense`, allowing components to be loaded only when required.

### 23. What is the purpose of `useLayoutEffect`?
`useLayoutEffect` is similar to `useEffect`, but it runs synchronously after all DOM mutations. It is useful for reading layout from the DOM and synchronously re-rendering, preventing visual flickers.

### 24. Explain the concept of rendering lists in React.
Rendering lists involves using the `map()` function to iterate over an array and return an array of React elements. Each element should have a unique key to help React identify changes.

### 25. What are React Suspense and its benefits?
React Suspense is a feature that allows components to "wait" for some condition (like data loading) before rendering. It improves user experience by preventing a loading state from blocking the entire UI.

### 26. What are the common performance pitfalls in React applications?
- Excessive re-renders due to improper state management.
- Not using keys when rendering lists.
- Overusing context for state management.
- Not optimizing images or other assets.

### 27. How do you manage component state in React?
Component state can be managed using hooks like `useState` for local state and `useReducer` for more complex state. Global state can be managed using Context API or state management libraries like Redux.

### 28. What are side effects in React?
Side effects are operations that can affect other components and cannot be performed during rendering, such as data fetching, subscriptions, or manually changing the DOM.

### 29. How can you implement authentication in a React app?
Authentication can be implemented using Context API or Redux to manage user state, and routes can be protected based on authentication status. Libraries like `react-router` and `axios` can assist with routing and API calls.

### 30. What is the purpose of `React.createContext`?
`React.createContext` creates a Context object that can be used to share values (like theme or authentication status) between components without passing props down manually at every level.

### 31. How do you fetch data in a React application?
Data can be fetched using the `fetch` API or libraries like `axios` within the `useEffect` hook to manage side effects and update state with the fetched data.

### 32. What is the difference between `useEffect` and `useLayoutEffect`?
- `useEffect`: Runs asynchronously after the DOM has been painted, making it suitable for non-blocking side effects.
- `useLayoutEffect`: Runs synchronously after all DOM mutations, making it suitable for reading layout and triggering synchronous re-renders.

### 33. What is the purpose of the `useImperativeHandle` hook?
`useImperativeHandle` customizes the instance value that is exposed when using `ref` with a component. It allows you to define what should be exposed to parent components.

### 34. How do you create a custom hook in React?
Custom hooks are JavaScript functions that start with `use` and can call other hooks. They encapsulate reusable logic that can be shared across components.

### 35. What are the best practices for structuring a React application?
- Organize components logically by feature or functionality.
- Use functional components and hooks for new components.
- Separate presentational and container components.
- Use prop-types or TypeScript for type checking.

### 36. How do you handle error states in a React application?
Error states can be managed using error boundaries to catch errors in the component tree. You can also use state to track loading, success, and error states during data fetching.

### 37. What is the purpose of the `useCallback` hook?
`useCallback` is a hook that memoizes a callback function, preventing its recreation unless its dependencies change. This optimizes performance in components that depend on callback functions.

### 38. What is a compound component pattern?
The compound component pattern allows multiple components to work together while keeping their internal state in sync. It is typically used for components like tabs or accordions.

### 39. How do you implement a controlled component for a text input?
To implement a controlled component, bind the input's `value` attribute to the component's state and use the `onChange` event to update the state with the input's value.

### 40. What are some strategies for managing global state in React?
- Context API: Share state across components without prop drilling.
- Redux: Use for complex state management with actions and reducers.
- Zustand or Recoil: Alternative libraries for managing global state.

### 41. What is the difference between `React.Fragment` and an array?
Both `React.Fragment` and arrays allow grouping multiple elements without adding extra nodes. However, `React.Fragment` can accept keys, whereas arrays cannot.

### 42. What are some methods for optimizing rendering performance?
- Use `React.memo` and `PureComponent` to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
- Use the `key` prop to help React identify changes in lists.
- Use `useCallback` and `useMemo` to memoize functions and values.

### 43. How can you improve the user experience when loading data?
- Show loading indicators or skeleton screens while data is being fetched.
- Implement pagination or infinite scroll for large datasets.
- Cache previously fetched data for faster retrieval.

### 44. How do you integrate third-party libraries in a React application?
Third-party libraries can be integrated by installing them via npm/yarn and importing the required components or functions into your React components.

### 45. What is the purpose of the `useDebugValue` hook?
`useDebugValue` is a hook that can be used to display a label for custom hooks in React DevTools, making it easier to debug and visualize custom hook states.

### 46. How can you test React components?
React components can be tested using libraries like Jest and React Testing Library. Tests can be written for rendering, user interactions, and ensuring the expected output.

### 47. What is the role of PropTypes in React?
PropTypes are a way to validate the props passed to components, ensuring that they are of the correct type and structure. It helps in catching bugs and improving code readability.

### 48. What are render props in React?
Render props are a technique for sharing code between components using a prop whose value is a function. This function returns a React element, allowing for dynamic rendering based on shared logic.

### 49. How do you handle authentication and authorization in a React app?
Authentication can be handled using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) and protected routes using React Router. You can manage user state and role-based access using Context API or Redux.

### 50. What is the purpose of the `useTransition` hook?
`useTransition` is a hook that allows you to mark updates as non-urgent, enabling React to prioritize rendering more important updates first. It helps improve the user experience during heavy rendering tasks.

### 51. How can you handle side effects in a functional component?
Side effects can be handled using the `useEffect` hook. You can define the effect and cleanup function, which runs when the component mounts, updates, or unmounts.

### 52. What is the difference between client-side rendering (CSR) and server-side rendering (SSR)?
- **CSR**: Renders content in the browser, often resulting in faster interactions but potentially slower initial load times.
- **SSR**: Renders content on the server and sends fully rendered pages to the client, improving initial load times and SEO.

### 53. How do you manage dependencies in the `useEffect` hook?
Dependencies can be managed by providing an array as the second argument to `useEffect`. The effect will only re-run if the values in this array change.

### 54. What is the purpose of the `useContext` hook?
`useContext` is a hook that allows components to access context values directly without needing to wrap them in a `Context.Consumer`. It simplifies consuming context in functional components.

### 55. What are controlled vs. uncontrolled components?
- **Controlled Components**: Input values are managed by React state.
- **Uncontrolled Components**: Input values are managed by the DOM, and refs are used to access values.

### 56. What is the purpose of the `useDebugValue` hook?
`useDebugValue` is a hook that allows you to display a label for custom hooks in React DevTools, aiding in debugging.

### 57. How can you prevent a component from re-rendering?
You can prevent re-renders using `React.memo` for functional components or `shouldComponentUpdate` in class components to control when a component should update.

### 58. What is the role of the `useReducer` hook in state management?
`useReducer` allows managing complex state logic in functional components, providing a predictable way to handle state transitions and side effects.

### 59. How do you handle pagination in a React application?
Pagination can be implemented by fetching a subset of data based on the current page and displaying only the relevant items, often with next and previous buttons for navigation.

### 60. How can you integrate API calls in React?
API calls can be integrated using the `fetch` API or libraries like `axios`, typically within the `useEffect` hook to manage side effects and update component state.
